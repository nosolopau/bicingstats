= Bicingstats

This application provides an historic record of the occupation data of the Barcelona's bicing system, by offering information retrieved from the {Bicing API}[http://rocboronat.net/index.php/es/projectes/48-bicing-api] by {Roc Boronat}[http://rocboronat.net].

You can see bicingstats in action at {bicingstats.heroku.com}[http://bicingstats.heroku.com].

= Configuration

The application uses a configuration file that can be found at config/config.yml. Inside this configuration file there are two pairs key-value, as follows: 

  samples_service_url: http://rocboronat.net/barcelonabicing/bcnJ?all=1
  token: "abda821ss"

The param +samples_service_url+ indicates the URL for data retrieval. The param +token+ is a security paraphrase that can be used to securize access to the update data function.
